# Steps to Download the Kernel and patch it with wrapfs of same version.#



1) Download the wrapfs from http://download.filesystems.org/wrapfs/patches/
	
#Note:wrapfs stackable file system is present only for selected versions so 
before downloading the kernel ensure that there is wrapfs for that version. 
	
2) Download the linux kernel from https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/ 
   by selecting appropriate version.

3) After downloading the kernel untar it with the following command from 
   the same directory.

$ tar -xvf linux-x.x.x.tar.gz

4) Untar the wrapfs as well by the following cammand from the same 
   directory.

$ gunzip wrapfs-vx.x.x-x-xxxxxx.diff.gz 

5) Change the present working directory to the linux directory root which 
   is where we want to patch the wrapfs.

6) Patch the wrapfs with the following cammand

$ patch -p1 < /home/../../wrapfs-vx.x.x-x-xxxxxx.diff

7) After successful patching we need to compile a kernel and turn on the 
   wrapfs functionality. We need to enable the support for wrapfs in kernel 
   config file. Follow the Kernel compilation steps:

$ make menuconfig 
		(You will see the UI in witch you can select and move up down)
 
		1) Scroll down and select : File systems  ---> 

		2) Scroll down and select : Miscellaneous filesystems  --->

		3) Scroll down and select with spacebar and make it 
       		   “<M> modular support features” :”Wrapfs stackable file system”.

		4) After this save the changes to the .config file, and exit from 
       		   menuconfig UI.


Compile the Linux Kernel

	Compile the main kernel:
$ make
	Compile the kernel modules:
$ make modules
	Install the kernel modules:
$ make modules_install
	At this point, you should see a directory named /lib/modules/x.x.x/ in your system.



Install the New Kernel
	Install the new kernel on the system:
$ make install
	The make install command will create the following files in the 
  	/boot directory.
  
	vmlinuz-x.x.x– The actual kernel
	System.map-x.x.x – The symbols exported by the kernel.

8) Boot from the installed version selecting from advanced options from 
   the menu list at the booting time.

9) Download or clone the wrapfs-nektech from https://github.com/NEKTech-Labs/wrapfs-nektech
   and untar it with the following command
	
$  unzip wrapfs-nektech-master.zip

10) Change directory to the folder wrapfs-nektech and compile the wrapfs 
    to generate kernel object file of name wrapfs.ko by the following command

$ make

11) Insert the wrapfs.ko into the kernel by using following command 

$ sudo insmod wrapfs.ko

12) After successful insertion we need to mount this filesystem, to mount use the 
    following command 

$ mount -t wrapfs <directory_name_1> <directory_name_2>
		
		 directory_name_1--> mount point
		 directory_name_2--> replication directory
